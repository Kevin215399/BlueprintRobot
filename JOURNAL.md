## 10/20/2025 - Gear Testing  

I learned how to create gears and simulate them in Fusion 360. I followed this tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCMjsYvVTc. I saw a really cool differential would be able to move the arm in two axis using bevel gears. I hope to use stepper motors for the large segments and a 9g servo for the gripper. I have one leftover 27kg servo but that might be overkill for the gripper.![10-20 timer.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1aa775cebc2a3343b9a07c297bc01b42ba612567/10-20%20timer.png)

## 10/21/2025 - Differential Start  

I started working on the differential. I want to put this right before the gripper. It took a long time to find the right parts and I had to restart a couple of times. I am planning to control the differential using belts controlled by Nema 17 40mm bipolar stepper motors. I found the parts using Mc-Master Carr. I have some leftover belts from version 2, but they might not be the right size.![10-21 progress.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDIyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f903f4adfb58302a31ccbb9b02705303dffee38f/10-21%20progress.png)

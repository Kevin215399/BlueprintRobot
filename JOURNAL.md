## 10/20/2025 - Gear Testing  

I learned how to create gears and simulate them in Fusion 360. I followed this tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCMjsYvVTc. I saw a really cool differential would be able to move the arm in two axis using bevel gears. I hope to use stepper motors for the large segments and a 9g servo for the gripper. I have one leftover 27kg servo but that might be overkill for the gripper.![10-20 timer.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1aa775cebc2a3343b9a07c297bc01b42ba612567/10-20%20timer.png)

## 10/21/2025 - Differential Start  

I started working on the differential. I want to put this right before the gripper. It took a long time to find the right parts and I had to restart a couple of times. I am planning to control the differential using belts controlled by Nema 17 40mm bipolar stepper motors. I found the parts using Mc-Master Carr. I have some leftover belts from version 2, but they might not be the right size.![10-21 progress.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDIyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f903f4adfb58302a31ccbb9b02705303dffee38f/10-21%20progress.png)

## 10/22/2025 - Developing the differential casing  

I worked on building up the case around the differential and it's motors. I had these leftover belts from my last robot arm. I used desmos to figure out the correct distances I would need to mount the motors. Thankfully the distance between the motors is just over 40mm which is the minimum spacing. I am planning on using two hall-effect sensors to home the differential. I still need to figure how exactly to assemble it but progress is going well.![10-22 progress.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f22bd38e15c3c89c78e517884d970e6754bf3296/10-22%20progress.png)

## 10/23/2025 - Encoder Positions  

I came across these really interesting magnetic encoders; https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Encoder-Induction-Measurement-Precision/dp/B097QNG1CN/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.sRkyQzCSLKrouEOa6e23GqsfZxDJu_2YHQAp_voUAUmSokxT2AlzQyX-yh8Z-4leQJuMwocaxFgj38EDdAspqBpHUse8SbXTfSvwcliej-quiJhbnniF6k4blvH3OiQ5Z_vikyVGQNFn86bOTLPEB0G8o0AEwexF1p7unKbJA905vU3FWZYPwTzro55U8TymUo_FUuIkyctq-9QywVJuh9AbWD-T2eh6CxCZUEnN7_4.U5Knigxo_EoVzdTMWIOEghShUINV1iGu1rnSq3dTVCY&dib_tag=se&keywords=hall%2Beffect%2Bencoder&qid=1761266110&sr=8-3&th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor. They use the poles to determine the orientation. I made the horizontal axis coaxial and attached a magnetic encoder on the outside. I also Added another one on the top with a hole leading down for the wires. I am concerned how to go about controlling the nema 17 40mm motors and might downgrade to a smaller motor![10-23 cross section.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDk0OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e66bd32094cbad0035822beb0e618cd430f64b19/10-23%20cross%20section.png)

## 10/25/2025 - Finished Segment  

Beyond some places for screws, this segment of the arm is completed. I also spent a while researching the motors and how to control/power them. Unfortunately the motors require a large controller unit that will take up quite a bit of space and budget.![10-25 timer](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7694dad50798ab1f863c9e05416de7eaed291165/10-25%20timer.png)![10-25 pic1](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c936f553e3bd69441c877905c44ff65ac2ce89a2/10-25%20pic1.png)![10-25 pic2](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fa62e597b8927ee3e883c1de6f3fd36c9c6b964d/10-25%20pic2.png)![10-25 pic3](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYwOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3778ebbf85c47f867c725631b67e8684f4858eab/10-25%20pic3.png)
  

## 10/27/2025 - Started the base  

I started on the base of the robot. I positioned the motor facing down with gears so that It isn't top heavy. I added a slot around the larger gear that fits into another slot improving stability. I have 1 problem the assembly and I still need to make the mount for the motor.![10-27 base](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--abf7f90fed6db4331d1b1428588f5ca4feda8306/10-27%20base.png)
